# Workshop Files Repository

Welcome to the Workshop Files Repository! This repository contains the codes and files used in professional workshops for our organization.

## Folders

The repository is organized into folders based on the different workshop topics covered. Currently, the following folders exist:

- [PyAutoGUI Workshop](./PyAutoGUI%20Workshop/)
- [Selenium Workshop](./Selenium%20Workshop/)

Each folder contains the relevant files for that workshop, including code samples, documentation, and presentation materials.
